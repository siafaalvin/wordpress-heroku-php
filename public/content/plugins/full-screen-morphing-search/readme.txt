Responsive Full Screen Morphing Search Page Overlay With Predictive Autocomplete !

= Full Screen Morphing Search =

Effect for any WordPress search input that morphs into a fullscreen overlay.  
Enlarge the search input and show 5 most recent posts, 5 most used categories and tags with counter.  
Once the input is clicked, the whole search element expands to a fullscreen overlay.  
The fullscreen overlay has a bigger search input.

There are no settings for this plugin. Simply activate it, click on any search input and see the magic happens !

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Recent posts thumbnails are not round ! =

You will have to use a thumbnail regenerator.  
I recommend <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/force-regenerate-thumbnails/" title="Force Regenerate Thumbnails" target="_blank">Force Regenerate Thumbnails</a>.

= The overlay is not covering the whole page ! =
If your theme has some boxed style(s), like Twenty Sixteen or Twenty Twelve,  
the overlay will only cover the inside box (the site content) !

= Autocomplete predicts only posts and pages ! =
Yes, just for now !  
I'll be adding some more cool functions with time.
